 It sounds like you're describing the benefits of using Telepresence, an open-source tool that allows developers to test their code changes locally against live services in Kubernetes clusters without having to commit, build, and deploy. This can significantly speed up the feedback loop for development and testing on microservices architectures.

Here's a summary of how it works:

1. Write your code on your local machine.
2. Use Docker Compose or any other means to run your service locally using Docker.
3. Telepresence is installed on both your local machine and the remote Kubernetes cluster.
4. When you use Telepresence, it intercepts incoming requests to a specific service in the remote cluster and redirects them to your local machine where you're making changes. This means that when you change something in your local code, it appears as if it has already been deployed on the Kubernetes cluster.
5. You can test your changes locally, receive feedback, and fix issues quickly without having to go through the entire CI/CD pipeline.

Some key benefits of using Telepresence include:

- Faster feedback loop for development and testing on microservices architectures.
- Ability to test in a stage environment before deploying to production.
- Personal interception mode allows developers to test and debug specific services without affecting others.
- Open-source, meaning you don't have to worry about losing it in the future.
- Ducker Desktop extension for easy setup and use.

You can find more detailed instructions on how to set up Telepresence in your environment in this blog post: [Telepresence for Kubernetes](https://medium.com/@michaeleisel/telepresence-for-kubernetes-773d386e43a1).

Overall, Telepresence can help make the development and testing process more efficient and productive by reducing the time spent on building, deploying, and testing code changes.
