 It seems like you've explained very well how multi-stage builds work in Docker and provided a clear demonstration using a Go application. To summarize, multi-stage builds allow you to create multiple containers during the build process, each with its own set of instructions. You can copy artifacts from one stage to another, but you don't need to keep the entire operating system or unnecessary dependencies in your final image. This results in a smaller and more optimized Docker image.

In your example, you had four stages:
1. Base stage using an LP image as a base.
2. cuan 2 stage running a 'hello' command.
3. Debian stage running a 'conference' command.
4. Final stage copying elements from the previous stages and combining them into your final image.

By doing this, you were able to reduce an application size of 200MB to just 20MB. This method is useful for any Docker images where you can separate tasks based on specific environments or operating systems, copy only the necessary elements into the final image, and avoid keeping the whole operating system in your image.

You also showed a comparison between a regular Dockerfile and a multi-stage Dockerfile, explaining how the latter optimizes the image by separating build steps and only including the executable in the final image. You then demonstrated the difference in image size between a simple Dockerfile and one with multi-stage builds and confirmed that both applications had the same behavior and expected outcome.

Overall, your explanation was clear, and your demonstration was helpful in understanding the benefits of using multi-stage builds in Docker. Thank you for sharing this information!
