 This text provides a tutorial on securing a Kubernetes cluster. Here are some key points:

1. Secrets in Kubernetes are base64 encoded by default, but they should be encrypted using managed Kubernetes, as they may contain sensitive information.
2. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) is important for restricting access to specific things within the Kubernetes environment, such as service accounts and namespaces.
3. Set the `privileged` field in pods and containers to false to prevent escalation of privileges. This helps to avoid deploying images with Pudu commands or other malicious code.
4. The security context in APIs on pods and containers implements various security measures, such as running as non-root, limiting privileged escalation, etc. A blog post provides more details about the 10 most important things to pay attention to regarding security context.
5. Network policy is a powerful tool for firewalling within the Kubernetes cluster. It allows you to specify which pods can communicate with each other and restricts communication between nodes.
6. Implement admission controllers like OPA's Gatekeeper, Kerno, or even the built-in Pod Security Admission PSA to enforce security policies and prevent bad practices from being deployed in the cluster.
7. Use tools like Sneak for scanning containers locally and within your CI/CD pipeline to identify potential security issues proactively and provide solutions. The tool can also scan source code for potential vulnerabilities.
8. Practice defense-in-depth by preparing for a variety of potential threats, as no tool can catch everything. For example, if Network policy blocks remote code execution exploits, it may still be possible to create a denial-of-service attack instead.
9. Visit snak.io to learn more about the tools offered and how they can help secure your Kubernetes cluster. The tools are free for developer use, and additional resources like blog posts and training sessions are available.
10. Continuously improve your security posture by learning from the open-source community and staying up-to-date on best practices.
