 It sounds like you have a well-structured approach to managing your infrastructure using Terraform, with three main types of resources: identical components, configuration-specific components, and reusable components. For the database module, you use an `ISDN` flag to determine whether to create a standalone or replicated database.

To ensure parallel deployment in both environments without region coupling, you configure different container registry URLs for each environment. Your documentation process is commendable, as you document actions during the first test execution and maintain a reliable execution plan document.

You mentioned preparing for potential disasters, especially full region outages, and emphasized the importance of resilience for edge cases. To assess your infrastructure's resilience level, you use AWS Resilience Hub and AWS Fault Injection Simulator tools. These tools help identify configuration issues and test your system's disaster handling capabilities.

Your key takeaways include:

1. RTO (Recovery Time Objective), RPO (Recovery Point Objective), and business needs should guide your technical decisions.
2. Understand the limitations of your cloud provider services, as they may not function optimally during a disaster.
3. Maintain a DRP state of mind when making changes to your infrastructure, considering potential impacts on the DRP.
4. Create a detailed execution plan document, anticipating that manual steps will be more complicated under pressure.
5. Regularly test and improve your DRP through continuous testing in a duplicate test environment or production (Chaos Engineering approach).
6. Some companies prefer having occasional production issues rather than theoretical DRPs that may not work when needed.
