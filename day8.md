 It seems like you are giving a tutorial on using OpenTofu with Terraform to manage infrastructure. Here's a summary of the steps you outlined:

1. Install OpenTofu: You can install it via Homebrew if you're on a Mac, or download it from the official website for other operating systems. The command to install OpenTofu is `brew install opentofu`.

2. Initialize OpenTofu in your repository: This will set up OpenTofu and prepare it to manage your infrastructure code.

3. Review the existing infrastructure: You mentioned that there are currently two instances of Keycloak and one instance of PostgreSQL running. This is the resource you would like to deploy or replicate.

4. Get the Terraform code for the desired infrastructure: You can find this on the Terraform Provider Registry or from an existing Terraform file.

5. Make changes to the Terraform file as needed: In your case, you wanted to create a third instance of Keycloak.

6. Run `opentofu apply` command: This will provision and configure the infrastructure according to the changes made in the Terraform file.

7. Check the updated infrastructure: After the `opentofu apply` command completes, you can verify that the changes have been applied by refreshing your dashboard or running additional commands as needed.

8. Destroy the infrastructure (optional): You can destroy the infrastructure using the command `opentofu destroy`. However, keep in mind that the compatibility of the state file with OpenTofu's migration process is important to avoid issues when upgrading Terraform versions.

9. Contribute to the OpenTofu community: If you have any feature requests or issues, you can post them on the OpenTofu Community forum for feedback and resolution.

Overall, OpenTofu seems like a powerful tool for managing infrastructure as code, especially when working with Terraform. Thanks for sharing this tutorial!
